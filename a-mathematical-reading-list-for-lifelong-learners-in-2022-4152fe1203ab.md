The number of mathematical books that are now available is staggering. Sometimes, you might feel obligated to read all those books, and I have decided to provide my favorite math and science books that you should discover to be beneficial to solve that issue.

Below, you will see 60+ pretty interesting math books that I believe anyone who enjoys mathematics should read them. I can guarantee that you will learn something new from each of the books in this collection. Because when I first this list, I told myself that I would finish all those books in two years. And I did and learned millions of things.

And I have some good news for you. Firstly, all those math books should be available in your local library, so you don’t need to pay for them. Secondly, since those math books are not textbooks, the Kindle versions are readable and reasonably priced.

Friends, Romans, countrymen! A new year is coming, and it is a good time to make plans for getting new and valuable habits for ourselves. I believe you should promise yourself and try to read these math books as much as possible in 2022.

## Solving Mathematical Problems by Terence Tao

Terence Tao is a winner of the Fields Medal. He calls this short book ‘a perspective,’ and he is right. Perhaps no one better suited to provide a personal viewpoint on problem-solving than he is. At the age of 13, he became the youngest gold medal winner in the history of the International Mathematical Olympiad. There are easy puzzles, challenging problems, and good insights sprinkled throughout the entire book. The problems are primarily geometric and algebraic, with some number theory thrown in for good measure.

## A Russian Childhood by S. Kovalevskaya

After being appointed a professor at the University of Stockholm in 1889, Sonya Kovalevskaya made history by becoming the first woman in modern times to hold a lectureship at a European university. She did so even though she was a woman, a foreigner, a socialist, and an adherent to the newly developed Weierstrassian theory of analysis. Her childhood recollections are not only fascinating, but they are also non-mathematical. She discovered the idea of infinitesimals in her nursery, where the walls had been covered with pages of mathematical notes due to the difficult economic circumstances.

## Alan Turing, the Enigma by A. Hodges

This book is an excellent biography of Alan Turing, a pioneer of modern computers who lived during the twentieth century. In this case, the title has a double meaning: the guy himself was an enigma, and the Enigma machine generated the German code that he was vital in deciphering. Although the book is primarily non-mathematical, there are no bars barred when detailing his key achievement, which is now known as a Turing machine. He was able to demonstrate that a well-known conjecture of Hilbert was incorrect.

## A Mathematician’s Apology by G.H. Hardy

Hardy was a brilliant mathematician who lived during the first half of the twentieth century. He was a high achiever who was instrumental in bringing about a revival in mathematical analysis in England. Graham Greene was aware of no other piece of writing that conveyed the thrill of the creative artist as simply and with such a lack of fuss as this. C.P. Snow provides an introduction to the book.

## The Man Who Loved Only Numbers by Paul Hoffman

Paul Erdos, one of the most prolific mathematicians, is profiled in this extraordinary biography. Erdos published approximately 1500 publications (about ten times the average number of papers published by a mathematician) and cooperated with 485 other mathematicians during his lifetime. With nowhere to call home, he just descended on colleagues with whom he desired to collaborate, transporting all of his stuff in a single suitcase. Apart from the specifics of Erdos’s life, there is a great deal of discussion about the problems.

## Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman by R.P. Feynman

One of the greatest theoretical physicists of the twentieth century shared autobiographical experiences in a book that became an instant best-seller. Science, life, and (the most perplexing of all) Feynman’s theories are all covered in this course. This is a very amusing and enjoyable book.

## Fermat’s Last Theorem by Simon Singh

This story of Andrew Wiles’s demonstration of Fermat’s Last Theorem is a perennial favorite. He does an excellent job of describing some of the complicated mathematics at the heart of Andrew Wile’s proof while incorporating various mathematical ideas and anecdotes throughout the book. The majority of mathematics research, on the other hand, is not as compulsive and buried in secret as this particular investigation. Despite this, the book reads almost as if it were a thrilling thriller (with some amusing digressions) and expresses a genuine excitement for the wonders of mathematics.

## The Music of the Primes by Marcus du Sautoy

An extensive historical examination of a significant portion of mathematics is presented, with the Riemann Hypothesis serving as a common thread connecting all of the sections. The Riemann Hypothesis is considered one of the most challenging problems in mathematics. Although it is one of the Clay Institute’s million-dollar problems, it is unlikely to ever be the focus of a bar conversation, unlike Fermat’s final theorem. Du Sautoy’s book is intelligent and tastefully written. However, while some mathematics is challenging, the history and storytelling provide a compelling (and appealing) picture of the world of professional mathematics.

## Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe by Leon M. Lederman and Christopher T. Hill

To comprehend the physics principles that govern the Universe, it is necessary first to grasp the concept of symmetry. A significant accomplishment of this book is its ability to make some of the most sophisticated and profound topics in current physics understandable to a public readership while employing the least amount of mathematical equations possible. This book will take you from classical mechanics, including studies of inertia in the solar system and Newton’s laws, to Noether’s theorem and the relationship between symmetry and conservation laws, as well as to Einstein’s relativity, the standard model, and the Higgs boson. There are numerous original and fascinating stories and analogies interspersed throughout the tour. Highly recommended, albeit be wary with the Kindle edition, which contains numerous typos.

## Closing the Gap: The Quest to Understand Prime Numbers by Vicky Neale

Some well-known mathematical problems have the peculiar property of being extremely simple to state but highly complex to solve. Fermat’s final theorem, for example, is a good illustration. Another example is the twin prime conjecture, which is the subject of this book. According to this conjecture, there are many prime integers whose difference is equal to 2. As you may expect from the name, no proof has been discovered to date. Neale does an excellent job of guiding the reader through many attempts to get closer to proving the conjecture and teaching the fundamentals of number theory and cutting-edge mathematical notions in a manner that is both understandable and rigorous. In addition, the book has a large number of challenges that will force you to think, which is always entertaining and beneficial!

## Euler’s Pioneering Equation by Robin Wilson

Euler’s equation, e^iπ + 1 = 0, unites five of the most important integers in mathematics. It has been named the most beautiful mathematical theorem numerous times, including once as the most beautiful mathematical theorem globally. MRI scans have revealed that this elegant and deeply meaningful equation has the same effect on mathematicians’ brains as a piece of art! Robin Wilson investigates each of the numbers in turn, beginning with their historical mathematical evolution and concluding with the equation itself in the last chapter. Numerous methods of approximating, anecdotes, and “near misses” by renowned former mathematicians, applications, and proofs will all be covered in this book. This is a must-have for math enthusiasts, a book for the curious and engaging introduction to some fundamental mathematical notions.

![Euler’s Pioneering Equation](math/1_PRoNqUx19l9BteaTcEoksw.png)

## The Colossal Book of Mathematics by M. Gardner

Gardner’s work is worth about 700 pages for less than 20 pounds, which is an incredible value. If you haven’t seen it before (and most likely even if you have), the very first topic in the book will catch you in: a diophantine issue involving a monkey and some coconuts — I can’t say much more without giving too much away about the plot. In the book’s opening, there is a list of approximately 60 previous novels by Martin Gardner, none of which will disappoint.

## Cakes, Custard and Category Theory: Easy recipes for understanding complex maths by Eugenia Cheng

This book is a must-read, entertaining, inventive, and brimming with contagious passion and unexpectedly mathematical recipes. The use of baking analogies may appear a little clumsy at times, but they are effective on the whole.

## The Norm Chronicles: Stories and numbers about danger by David Spiegelhalter and Michael Blastland

David Spiegelhalter is the Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge. He is an excellent presenter of mathematics: visit his website at https://understandinguncertainty.org/ for more information. A ‘guide to risk,’ the book is told through numbers and stories about the imaginary characters Norm and Prudence (both of whom are self-explanatory), as well as the irresponsible Kelvin. In this book, you will learn about the micromort (a chance of dying one in a million times), the micro life (30 minutes of life), and a slew of other fascinating facts and figures. For example, did you know that the radiation dose received while flying from London to New York is equivalent to the amount received by eating 700 bananas? The usual scare stories in the media will be viewed completely after reading this book, which will be both entertaining and educational!

## The MαTH βOOK by Clifford A Pickover

There is a primarily non-mathematical exposition of one of the famous mathematical results on each left-hand page and an illustration of that result on the right-hand pages. Only enough mathematical detail is provided for you to comprehend the result and, if you so like, explore it further using Google. The book has been exquisitely created. Several hundred pages into Russell and Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica, which is considered the 23rd most influential non-fiction work of the twentieth century, is the postulate 1+1=2, which appears several hundred pages later on a page dedicated to Russell and Whitehead.

## Mathematics: a Very Short Introduction by Timothy Gowers

For someone who holds the Fields Medal (which is considered the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize), it should be no surprise that what he writes is worthwhile to read. What is remarkable is the ease with which he writes and the elegance he communicates. He touches on a wide range of mathematical topics, which will be familiar to readers (Pythagoras, for example). In contrast, others will be unfamiliar (manifolds), and he has something interesting to say about each of them. The book is compact and thin, and it will easily fit in your pocket or backpack. It’s something you should get.

## The Pleasures of Counting by T.W. Körner

This is an excellent book. There is something here for everyone interested in mathematics, and even the most erudite professional mathematicians will find something new to learn from this collection. Some chapters provide only a smattering of technical mathematics. In contrast, some situations necessitate the use of concepts learned in a first- or second-year undergraduate course. You may, however, skim over the technical details and still have a general understanding of what is going on. Enjoy the narrative of Braess’ paradox, the explanation of why we should all be given the name Smith and the story of how Enigma code-breaking was accomplished. The themes listed above are just a handful of Körner’s, many with amazing clarity and humor.

## What is Mathematics? by R. Courant & H. Robbins

A new version of a classic, revised by Ian Stewart, is available. It contains chapters on numbers (including the symbol ), logic, cubics, duality, soap operas, and other topics. This book’s subtitle (An elementary approach to ideas and procedures) is a little too optimistic: difficult would be a more fitting description, though entertaining and educational would also suffice in this case. While Stewart has refrained from tampering with the book, he has updated it when necessary. For example, he discusses the solution to the four-color issue and the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem where they are relevant.

## Reaching for Infinity by S. Gibilisco

It was a quick and comfortable read about several types of infinity, even though it is mathematical. It also contains theorems, which are beneficial to your health. As an illustration, consider the equation 0 + 1 = 1. This is likely to necessitate some further explanation. In layman’s terms, the number of integers (which is the same as the number of rational numbers) is 0 (pronounced “aleph” zero), and the number of infinities beyond that is 1 (pronounced “aleph” one). There is another infinity, denoted by the symbol c = 20, representing the number of real numbers. However, the continuum hypothesis states that c = 1 wasn’t discovered until 1963 that this could not be proven or disproven until after the fact.

## The Mathematical Experience by P.J. Davis & R. Hersh

## Algorithms Unlocked by Thomas H. Cormen

What are algorithms, and why should you care? That is the question posed by this book. Mathematicians need to be concerned about this issue, given the widespread use of computers in mathematics and the overlap between what may be termed as “algorithmic thinking” and “mathematical thinking.” Donal Knuth published an article in The American Mathematical Monthly in which he examined precisely this overlap. He concluded that the overlap is nearly complete, except for two major concepts: “complexity,” which he defined as the economy of operation, and “dealing with infinite.” When it comes to problem-solving with computers and the underlying concepts of cryptography or the fundamental ideas of data compression, this book offers an exciting and readable introduction to both topics. It provides answers to a variety of intriguing topics, such as: “What does it mean to produce a correct solution to a problem?”

## Black Hole Blues by Janna Levin

The collision of two black holes occurred in a galaxy long ago in the far distant past. The impact was so strong that it generated a breach in the spacetime continuum, which resulted in ripples in the spacetime continuum that we refer to as gravitational waves. These waves went unhindered across the Universe for 1.4 billion years before we were able to detect their presence on September 14, 2015. In the third year, you will learn about Einstein’s theory of general relativity and gravitational waves, which are both topics that will be covered in depth. Meanwhile, this book is a fantastic location to begin your research.

## The Particle at the End of the Universe by Sean Carroll

The elementary particle landscape hasn’t changed much since this fascinating study was published: it was published just in time to report the Z and W particles discovered at the same time. Indeed, it expresses well-founded doubt over claims of having observed the top quark. The final chapter establishes the critically crucial connection between particle physics and cosmology. To investigate the most recent batch of elementary particles, enormous amounts of energy must be expended; as a result, the Big Bang is the only practical “laboratory.”

## Advanced Problems in Mathematics: Preparing for University by S.T.C. Siklos

It is advised as preparation for any undergraduate mathematics subject, even if the student does not intend to take the Sixth Term, Examination Paper. It comprises a collection of STEP–like tasks, each of which includes suggestions, discussion, and complete solutions. There is an excellent introduction to the book, which includes two wholly worked examples. The problems are distinct from other A-level questions, and they are substantially longer and sometimes contain material from seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics, such as algebra and geometry. They are more like the types of problems you would meet in a university mathematics course, despite being based on school mathematics curricula and textbooks. It would be beneficial to work through one or both of these booklets to get your maths back on track following the summer break.

## A Concise Introduction to Pure Mathematics by Martin Liebeck

This is really good work. Liebeck gives a straightforward, well-explained introduction to a wide range of concepts that would be found in any first-year mathematics course, including His methodical technique coming to an end before the reader becomes too mired down in the details. There are practical examples and exercises written in the same light tone as the book.
